Why is the original design bad?
1. Dull colour scheme
2. No organised layout
3.  No proper description given for users to access various options.
4. Confusing icons and purpose of various settings not justified.

Changes I have made
1. Implemented a better colour scheme.
2. Provided descriptions to videos and options where necessary.
3. Used bright images corresponding to the colour scheme.
4. Used valid option names to make it user friendly.
5. Made a clean interface and avoided clutter.

How my changes make the UI UX better
1. I added description and provided valid and significant names to options so the user wont get confused.
2. Use of bright colour scheme gives a rich look resulting in improvement of UX.
3. Used images where necessary so user would understand exactly what must be done.
4. Avoided clutter and ensured the written data is visible in order to make it user friendly.
